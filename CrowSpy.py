# Testing out branches on GitHub here

# online edit test - will it appear locally?

# yes, online edits are now showing up in local version after Fetch Origin function in GitHub Explorer

# one more test to see if this is working the way I expect

# now trying to use ATOM as a text editor - check to see if all versions update

# yes - a change in ATOM updated in the local file after Git & Atom logged out

# online edit again - save as 'new branch' and see how it appears in Git Explorer

# and now yet another test - this with Atom again

# back to the Zenva tutorial - additions below

# in a minute, that is - now making edit to master on Git - see if can show locally, then in Atom
