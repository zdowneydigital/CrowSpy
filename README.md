creating a "cross-the-road" game using Pygame via Zenva Academy tutorials

Yodels.  I bought a game-dev sort of Humble Bundle a few weeks ago.  It included several tutorials from Zenva Academy. 

Python is a language that I am curious to learn, and the tutorial I'm following will result in a Cross-the-Road type of game, like Frogger.

I played a TON of Frogger in the 9th grade.  David Siples and I would walk to Reburger's Laundrymat for lunch each day and buy food from the vending machine.  We'd pump quarters into the Frogger arcade cabinet and take turns playing while eating SUPER healthy lunches, like Honey Buns and potato chips with Mountain Dew.

After several weeks of doing this, we got quite good at making that little frog cross the road and the river.  In fact, we got to the point where we only needed 1 quarter each.  On some days, we had to abandon our high-scoring games because the lunch hour was over and we had to return to school.

Anyway, I'm gonna follow the Zenva template, but will try to customize it as much as I can.

My version will be about a Crow that is a Spy.
